        <h2 id = "normal">Attributes(Normal)</h2>
        <p>Attributes are included to include details of the various entities that are highlighted in a conceptual ER diagram. Attributes are characteristics of an entity, a many-to-many relationship, or a one-to-one relationship. Multivalued attributes are those that are can take on more than one value.</p>
        <h2 id = "derived">Attributes(Derived)</h2>
        <p>A derived attribute is one whose value is dynamic and derived from another attribute. It is represented by dashed oval in an ER Diagram. For example – Person age is a derived attribute as it changes over time and can be derived from another attribute (Date of birth).</p>
        <h2 id = "multivalued">Attributes(Multivalued)</h2>
        <p>An attribute that can hold multiple values is known as multivalued attribute. It is represented with double ovals in an ER Diagram. For example – A person can have more than one phone numbers so the phone number attribute is multivalued.</p>
        <h2 id = "entity">Entity</h2>
        <p>An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data. An entity set is a collection of similar entities. These entities can have attributes that define its properties.</p>
        <h2 id = "foreign">Foreign-key</h2>
        <p> Foreign key is a field in a table that uniquely identifies a row in another table or same table. In this foreign key in ER diagram example, the foreign key is marked as FK. The way of producing a foreign key is to go to the setbox by clicking a key two times, then go down to the bottom and tap the radio button.</p>
        <h2 id = "inclusion">Inclusion</h2>
        <p>Inclusion allows us to deal with correlations as a whole entities and to be related with other sets of correlations.</p>
        <h2 id = "id_relation">Identifying Relationship</h2>
        <p>An identifying relationship is a relationship between two entities in which an instance of a child entity is identified through its association with a parent entity, which means the child entity is dependent on the parent entity for its identity and cannot exist without it.</p>
        <h2 id = "isa">Isa</h2>
        <p>The ISA relationship is used to model the hierarchy which is created as the class entity is decomposed into its logical sub-components. Customers may be PREFERRED_CUSTOMERS or NEW_CUSTOMERS, and orders may be COD_ORDERS or PREPAID_ORDERS, each with their own data items and behaviors.</p>
        <h2 id = "key">Key</h2>
        <p>A key is an attribute in ER diagrams whose values are distinct for each individual entity in an entity set.</p>
        <h2 id = "relation">Relation</h2>
        <p>A relationship type represents the association between entity types. For example,'Enrolled in' is a relationship type that exists between entity type Student and Course. In ER diagram, relationship type is represented by a diamond and connecting the entities with lines.</p>
        <h2 id = "Weak_Entity">Weak-Entity</h2>
        <p>A weak, or non-identifying, relationship exists if the primary key of the related entity does not contain a primary key component of the parent entity.</p>
